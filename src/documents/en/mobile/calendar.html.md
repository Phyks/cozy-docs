#### How to synchronize an existing calendar

If you want to synchronize an existing calendar with your Cozy, you will have to perform some manipulations. Create a new calendar inside Cozy, import your existing calendar into it, then create a new local calendar synchronized with Cozy. Here we go:

(this tutorial explains how to do with Thunderbird, the same applies to other clients).

* **First step : export your calendar from Thunderbird/ligthning**: in Thunderbird, open your calendar, select it in the left column, then right click on it and choose to export. You’ll get an `.ics` file;

* **2° step : create a new calendar in Cozy**: if needed, install the Calendar app, and open it. Click on the plus sign to create a new calendar, then on “Sync Settings” in the bottom of left column. Inside the popup, go to “iCalendar Import”, click on “Select an iCalendar file” and select the `.ics` file you exported at step 1;

* **3° step: get sync url**: inside Cozy, start Sync app, scroll to “CalDAV configuration (Calendar)” and click on “Thunderbird”. Choose the calendar you want to synchronize, and copy its URL;

* **last step: synchronize this new calendar with Thunderbird**: go back to Thunderbird, create a new calendar and sync it with the URL you just copied, as explained above. Don’t forget then to delete your initial, not synchronized, calendar, to prevent duplicates.
