# Import your Google data into your Cozy

In the following steps, we will show you how to import your calendar and
contacts from your Google account directly into your Cozy. 

## Step 1: Connect your Cozy to your Google account

When you connect to your Cozy for the first time, it will ask you 
information to work properly. Once this step done, your Cozy will propose you
to import data from your Google account. 

This operation requires you connect to Google and retrieve an authentication
token. This token allows your Cozy to access to your Google data. In the
following we will give you instructions to retrieve and use this token.

When you chose to import your data from Google, you will access to the import 
wizard. Once the first screen is displayed, click on the *Sign In To Google*
button: 

<div style="text-align: center">

</div>
<br />

Clicking on *Sign In To Google* will open a new navigator window or tab. This
new window will ask you to allow the Cozy navigator tab to access your Google
account. Accept by clicking on *Allow*.

<div style="text-align: center">

<br />

After this confirmation, Google will provide you with a token. Copy this
token and come back to your Cozy by closing the window.

Then, paste the token into the form displayed in your Cozy and validate it.

## Step 2: Import your data

Once validated, you can choose which kind of data you want to import in your
Cozy. Select contacts, calendars or both. Then click on *Import data*.

<br />
<div style="text-align: center">

<br />

Import is running...

When the import is finished, you can access to your calendar and contacts
from your Cozy app. Enjoy your data without Google!
